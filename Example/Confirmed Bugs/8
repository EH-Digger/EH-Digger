Hi,

I made some comments on your 3rd patch. Could you please combine
these three patches into a single series?

Also, please remove the [i2c] tag from the subject.

Thanks,
Andi

> This patch introduces error handling for the i2c_add_adapter. This missing
> error handling was identified through static analysis, revealing that the
> function did not properly address potential failures of i2c_add_adapter.
> Previously, such a failure could result in incomplete initialization of
> the I2C adapter, leading to erratic behavior.

> if the function is not highly time-sensitive. As the environment evolves
> or the code gets reused in different contexts, there's a possibility that
> these errors might occur. In case you find this addition unnecessary, I
> completely understand and respect your perspective. My intention was to
> enhance the robustness of the code, but I acknowledge that practical
> considerations and current functionality might not warrant this change
> at this point.
