Hi,

This can be improved a bit. Add a new label in the clean up path to
do the kfree, and just go to to that label.

In the error clean up part you now need to return 'err' at the end,
so make sure you also initialize 'err' to -ENOMEM to ensure the
correct error value is returned if usb_alloc_urb fails.

It's a bit cleaner that way and avoids duplicate cleanup paths.

Regards,

	Hans
